A tie can only be achieved when all the cells are filled. There is no other way to have a tie and stop the game then and there.

The aiPlayer is not trying to win. It just fills the next available empty space.

The huPlayer move is depicted by 'O' and that of aiPlayer by 'X'.
There are three possible outcomes of the game, at which it ends : huPlayer win, aiPlayer win and tie. At any of these outcomes, appropriate cells are rendered with a background and an overlay dialog declares the result in text.
The reset button removes all the background colors from the previous gameplay and removes the overlay dialog to present an empty board.





The gamplay is triggered by the user as soon as he clicks an empty spot. It ends only when there is an winning streak or if a player has a winning combination.
